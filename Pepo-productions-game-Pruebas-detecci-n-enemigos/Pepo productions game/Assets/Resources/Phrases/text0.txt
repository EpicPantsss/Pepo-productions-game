It happened a long time ago.
I got home after a long day at work, I sat on the couch in my living room and turned on the TV to watch the news, and...
I will never forget what I saw.
Terror flooded the streets as everyone ran for their lives, no one was safe from those murderous monsters.
I turned off the television in horror, only to realize that something was banging on my door.
The blows were increasing in force, until the door began to crack...
And finally, I discovered why anyone would faint in front of that thing, that slowly, started aproaching me.
